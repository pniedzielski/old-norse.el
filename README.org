Old Norse input method with postfix modifiers.  This file is based on
the =icelandic-postfix= input method that comes included with Emacs,
but adds input methods for =Ę=, =Ø=, =Œ=, and =Ǫ=.

The following key sequences are recognized (as well as lowercase
versions):

  - =A' → Á= 
  - =E' → É= 
  - =I' → Í= 
  - =O' → Ó= 
  - =U' → Ú= 
  - =Y' → Ý= 
  - =E, → Ę= 
  - =AE → Æ= 
  - =O/ → Ø= 
  - =OE → Œ= 
  - =O, → Ǫ= 
  - =D/ → Ð= (eth)
  - =T/ → Þ= (thorn)

Doubling the postfix separates the letter and postfix: e.g. =a'' →
a'=.
